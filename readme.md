A new blog management system designed according to Google [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

Back-end base on [Laravel 5.3](https://laravel.com), a PHP application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.

Front-end built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org), a Progressive JavaScript Framework bring data binding to js.

Demo at [Forehalo' blog](https://blog-demo.forehalo.com/).

## Feature

* Single page
* Creating with markdown (Javascript parser: [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked), PHP parser: [parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown))
* Code highlight ([Prism](http://prismjs.com))
* Self host comments
* Easy localization
* Use [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache) to cache static assets.

## Install

### Project

The php package manager [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/) is required for installing.

```
composer create-project forehalo/materialize-blog blog
```

It will automatically install laravel and other dependencies for you. 

> Or you can install from this git repository manually
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/forehalo/materialize-blog.git blog
> cd blog && composer install
> cp .env.example .env
> php artisan key:generate
> ```

Ensure you have finish all the steps mentioned in [`laravel docs`](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/installation).

Next step, migrate tables and seed fakers

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

> The `db:seed` command will seed `admin` and `settings` table. If you want to pre-generate some mock data, run again with option `--class=BlogSeeder`

Now you can login dashboard at `/dashboard` with name `admin` or email `admin@example.com`, password `admin`.

### Images

Maybe you want to store all images to local, it gives you an simple way.

Create an symbolic link `public/storage` target `storage/app/public`folder.

```
ln -s /path/to/storage/app/public/ public/storage
```

So now, you can upload images and get it with url `example.com/storage/images/image.jpg`. All images stored in `storage/app/public/images` folder.

## Pages

Materialize-blog also provide a way to publish pages. What you need to do is just writing a markdown file and store it under `storage/pages` folder. Then, you can access it by url `https://example.com/pages/{name}`, `name` is the markdown file name without extension `.md`. There is an existent page named `about`. Try it out.

## Custom

All front-end assets has been compiled so you could directly use them without compiling manually.

But if you don't like the default theme, hm... OK, install front-end environment and DIY.

```
yarn install    // or "npm install"
```

`yarn` is another package manager like `npm`, [read more](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/). 

Resources are putted in `/resources` folder.
```
├─assets
│  ├─fonts
│  │  └─material-design-icons        ------ icon files
│  ├─js                              ------ js workspace
│  │  ├─blog                           ------ user entery
│  │  │  ├─archives
│  │  │  ├─navigations
│  │  │  ├─pages
│  │  │  └─posts
│  │  ├─components                     ------ global components
│  │  └─dashboard                      ------ dashboard entery
│  │      ├─posts
│  │      └─settings
│  └─sass                            ------ sass workspace
│      ├─blog
│      └─dashboard
├─lang                               ------ language dictionary
│  ├─en
│  └─zh-CN
└─views
    ├─auth
    ├─blog
    └─dashboard
```

### Style & Script

run the following command after install all dependencies. This will watch all assets files, and auto-compile when change saved.

Before working, ensure you know well about [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).

```
yarn run dev
```

### Language

You can esaily add another language support by adding a subfolder in `resources/lang`. Every file returns a php array. Copy and translate all the files.

> Dictionary used by Vue should be putted in `resources/lang/your_lang/app.php`

Modify the `locale` item value to your default language folder name in `config/app.php`. Done!

Then, use `trans()` global helper function in PHP, and `this.$trans()` in Vue components.
